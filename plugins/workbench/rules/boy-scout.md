# Boy scout rule

Leave the tree better than you found it, and never let someone else's loose
end become a reason your own work is incomplete.

1. **Simplify what you touch.** If code you are already working in can be made
   simpler without changing behaviour, do it. Not a refactor tour - the files
   the task already puts in your hands.
2. **Functional but uncommitted work gets committed.** Uncommitted changes that
   work are not "someone else's problem" to route around. Review them, confirm
   they are green, and commit them.
3. **Uncommitted work that blocks full delivery must be cleared, not worked
   around.** Review it, adjust it until lint and tests pass, commit it as its
   own commit, then commit your work on top. Never leave your change sitting in
   a tree that was already broken, and never report a failure that belongs to
   pre-existing work as a reason your task is unfinished.

Commit boundaries stay honest: pre-existing work and your work are separate,
adjacent commits with their own messages. Fixing someone's lint does not make
their feature yours, and it does not get folded into your commit.

Do not commit work that is broken, half-finished, or that you cannot verify.
"Functional" means you ran the checks and they passed.
